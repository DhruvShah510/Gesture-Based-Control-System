# Gesture-Based-Control-System
Developed a gesture-based control system enabling real-time volume adjustment using the distance between index finger and thumb. Integrated a finger-based digit counter and hand gesture recognition (e.g., peace sign, open palm, fist). Built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe for efficient gesture tracking.
